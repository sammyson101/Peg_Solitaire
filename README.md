# Peg_Solitare

#This is a peg solitare game that runs on the command line.
#Based on an integer paramater from 0-14 that is passed with program call, the game will begin with that peg removed
#Based on the starting removed peg the program then recursivley calls a solveGame funtion until it has solved the game.
#A game is solved when one peg is reamaining, pegs are removed by jumping peges over each other into an empty spot, removing the one jumped over.
